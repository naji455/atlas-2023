	"description": "Depiction of Indians vandalizing Pakistani flag and Islamic sanctity by drawing it on a pig, which is a forbidden animal in Islam. Indians and Pakistani have a strong hatred for each other, henceforth, often lash out at each other by performing acts like these. In this case, Pakistanis did not participate in 2023 r/place as much as they did in 2017 or 2022 r/place, due to heavy aggressions towards their flags in 2017. Although maybe one or two Pakistanis planned to desecrate Indian mural, it did not happen as it was not a large scale plan.",
